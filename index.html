                1 GIVING TO CHARITY MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD<br>
                knowledge that youâ€™re helping others is hugely empowering and, in turn, can make you feel happier and
                more fulfilled. Research has identified a link between making a donation to charity and increased
                activity in the area of the brain that registers pleasure - proving that as the old adage goes, it
                really is far better to give than to receive.<br>
                <br>
                2 GIVING TO CHARITY STRENGTHENS PERSONAL VALUES<br>
                In our research, Why we give, a feeling of social conscience was the most widely-given reason to give to
                charity. Whatever type of charity work they supported, 96% said they felt they had a moral duty to use
                what they had to help others, a sentiment very much rooted in their personal values and principles.<br>
                <br>
                3 GIVING IS MORE IMPACTFUL THAN EVER<br>
                Many people are concerned that their donations to charity may be reduced by tax or administrative costs,
                preventing the full amount from reaching the people or causes they really want to help. Thankfully there
                are ways to make the most of every donation to charity.
